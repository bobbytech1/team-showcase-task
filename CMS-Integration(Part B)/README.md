## ✅ Part B – WordPress (CMS Integration Test)

To convert the React-based Team Showcase component into a fully functional WordPress plugin, I would follow these steps:

1. **Convert the Component into a WordPress Plugin using Gutenberg**  
   Since the component is already built with React and Tailwind CSS, the most natural approach is to register it as a **Gutenberg block**.

   - Structure the plugin with a `block.json` file and use **Vite** to bundle the React component (JSX + Tailwind).
   - Register the block in JavaScript using `registerBlockType()` from `@wordpress/blocks`:

     ```js
     import { registerBlockType } from '@wordpress/blocks';

     registerBlockType('team/showcase', {
       edit: () => <App />,
       save: () => null, // Output is handled via PHP render callback
     });
     ```

   - Ensure the plugin’s entry point (e.g., `block.jsx`) wraps the React component and renders it in the editor via the `edit` function.
   - Handle front‑end output with a PHP `render_callback` that injects a container `<div>` for the React app.
   - Compile Tailwind styles via PostCSS and enqueue them in both the editor and the front end.

2. **Fetch Team Data from Custom Post Types or ACF Fields**  
   To make the content dynamic:

   - Register a custom post type called `team_member` using `register_post_type()`.

     ```php
     function register_team_member_cpt() {
       register_post_type('team_member', [
         'label'        => 'Team Members',
         'public'       => true,
         'show_in_rest' => true,
         'supports'     => ['title', 'editor', 'thumbnail'],
       ]);
     }
     add_action('init', 'register_team_member_cpt');
     ```

   - Add each member’s details (name, title, image, bio, etc.) using **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**.
   - On the front end, fetch team member data via the WordPress REST API:

     ```bash
     GET /wp-json/wp/v2/team_member
     ```

   - If needed, expose ACF fields in the REST API by setting `show_in_rest => true` in the field group settings or by registering them programmatically.
   - This setup allows the React component to dynamically pull real team data without hardcoding anything.

3. **Make it Reusable on Multiple Pages via Shortcode or Block**  
   The flexibility comes in two forms:

   - **Gutenberg Block**  
     Users can simply insert the “Team Showcase” block anywhere via the block editor. This offers a great editor experience and supports live preview.

   - **Shortcode**  
     For classic editor users or custom template use, register a shortcode like `[team_showcase]`, which echoes a container `<div>` for the React app:

     ```php
     function team_showcase_shortcode() {
       return '<div id="team-showcase-block"></div>';
     }
     add_shortcode('team_showcase', 'team_showcase_shortcode');
     ```

     Enqueue the built JS/CSS so that when this div is present, the React component mounts automatically.

   This ensures the component is usable across pages, posts, and templates, supporting consistency site‑wide.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

By following these steps, the React-based Team Showcase component becomes a fully integrated, dynamic, and reusable part of any WordPress site. Leveraging Gutenberg for modern editing, ACF for flexible content management, and shortcodes for backward compatibility ensures both a great developer experience and a seamless user experience across all pages and templates.
